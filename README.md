# SvelteOpenCVWebsocket
This sample application uses Svelte, OpenCV, WebSockets, and the Drogon web server to process images or video streams either directly in the browser or via a server with OpenCV. Drogon handles the backend communication efficiently, enabling fast and scalable real-time image processing.
